# DiscoChat Code Overview

## Imports and Global Variables

The first part of the code imports the necessary modules and sets up global variables. It sets up the DiscoChat Discord bot's token, the OpenAI API key, various length limitations for messages, the model to be used for generating responses, and other important variables. It also sets up the discord client with the necessary permissions.

## Database Configuration

The script uses ChromaDB, an AI model and data store that is suited for high-dimensional vector space. The script initializes a connection to the ChromaDB client and sets up a "message_bank" collection.

## Message Storing Function

### *(store_document)*

This function takes a Discord message object, extracts relevant information (message author, creation time, content, whether DiscoChat is mentioned, server, and channel), and stores this data in the ChromaDB. It uses the Rake algorithm to extract keywords from the message content. The function also ensures that the message ID is unique to avoid duplicate storage.

## Message Retrieving Functions

### *(retrieve_relevant_messages, retrieve_recent_messages)*

These functions query the database and channel history respectively, to retrieve relevant and recent messages. They format these messages, tokenize them to monitor the total token count, and return the messages as strings.

## Command Handling Functions

### *(handle_command, populate_database, handle_channel_database_count, handle_channel_information_debug)*

These functions handle special commands that are given to the bot. They provide functionality like populating the database from past channel messages, providing a count of messages in the database from a specific channel, and giving debugging information about a channel.

## Other Utility Functions

### *(is_dm, is_command, async_chat_completion_create, on_ready, on_message)*

These functions provide miscellaneous utility. They check if a message is a command or a DM, create a message completion asynchronously, handle the bot's readiness event, and handle when the bot receives a message.

## Main Script Execution

The bot's main execution consists of registering the event handlers and running the bot using the Discord token. The bot responds to messages that mention it by retrieving recent and relevant messages, sending them along with the user's message to the OpenAI API, and sending the AI's response back to the channel. The bot also stores the messages it sees into the database.
